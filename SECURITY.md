## Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] All environment variables are properly set
- [ ] Database connection uses SSL
- [ ] API keys are secured and rotated
- [ ] Rate limiting is enabled
- [ ] Input validation is active
- [ ] Error handling is configured
- [ ] Security headers are enabled

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Review access logs weekly
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious activity
- [ ] Backup database regularly
- [ ] Test security features quarterly

### User Data Protection
- [ ] Personal data is encrypted at rest
- [ ] Data retention policies are enforced
- [ ] User consent is obtained for data collection
- [ ] GDPR compliance measures are in place

## Environment Variables

### Required for Production
```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# Payment Processing
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your-razorpay-key
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your-razorpay-secret

# AI Services
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key

# Email (if using email notifications)
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=587
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=your-email
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=your-password
```

### Security Best Practices
1. Use strong, unique secrets for each environment
2. Rotate API keys regularly
3. Use environment-specific configurations
4. Never commit secrets to version control

## API Security

### Authentication
- All sensitive endpoints require authentication
- Session-based authentication with NextAuth.js
- Role-based access control implemented

### Authorization
- Users can only access their own data
- Super admin role for administrative functions
- Plan-based feature restrictions

### Data Validation
- All inputs are validated and sanitized
- SQL injection prevention through Prisma ORM
- XSS prevention through content sanitization

## Monitoring & Logging

### Recommended Tools
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Error tracking (Sentry)
- Security monitoring
- Database monitoring

### Log Retention
- Application logs: 30 days
- Security logs: 90 days
- Database logs: 90 days

## Incident Response

### Security Breach Response
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve evidence
   - Notify stakeholders

2. **Investigation**
   - Identify root cause
   - Assess impact
   - Document findings

3. **Recovery**
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Restore from backups
   - Monitor for recurrence

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Update security measures
   - Review procedures
   - Train team members
